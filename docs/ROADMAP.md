## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk:** Windows API changes break detection
  - **Mitigation:** Version-specific detection logic, fallbacks
- **Risk:** Antivirus flags installer as malware
  - **Mitigation:** Code signing, whitelist with AV vendors
- **Risk:** Browser updates change data paths
  - **Mitigation:** CleanerML allows community updates

### Business Risks
- **Risk:** Low user adoption
  - **Mitigation:** Busan City partnership, free tier, local marketing
- **Risk:** License piracy
  - **Mitigation:** Online validation, hardware binding, reasonable pricing
- **Risk:** Competitor dominance (CCleaner)
  - **Mitigation:** Korean market focus, modern UI, Whale browser support
