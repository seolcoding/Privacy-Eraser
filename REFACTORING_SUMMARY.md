## ✨ Key Features Implemented

### 🎨 Dual-Mode UI
- ✅ **Easy Mode**: Wizard-style flow with 3 steps (Select Browsers → Choose Options → Review & Clean)
- ✅ **Advanced Mode**: Sidebar navigation with browser list + main panel with quick presets
- ✅ **Seamless Switching**: Mode toggle in header with state preservation

### 💾 Settings Persistence
- ✅ SQLite database at `~/.privacy_eraser/settings.db`
- ✅ Persists: UI mode, theme, debug state, autoscan, log level, CleanerML path
- ✅ Settings dialog with 3 tabs: General, Debug, Advanced

### 🎨 Visual Design
- ✅ Modern color palette (purple #667eea, green #10b981, gray neutrals)
- ✅ Responsive layouts with scrollable areas
- ✅ Vibrant browser icons with brand colors
- ✅ Smooth rounded corners (12-16px radius)
- ✅ Proper spacing and typography hierarchy

### 🐛 Debug Panel
- ✅ Collapsible panel at bottom
- ✅ Variables tab with app state inspection
- ✅ Console tab with live loguru streaming
- ✅ Controlled via Settings dialog

### 🔧 Architecture
- ✅ Modular file structure (9 new files)
- ✅ Centralized state management (`AppState`)
- ✅ Shared widget library (`gui_widgets.py`)
- ✅ Integration helpers for detection/cleaning (`gui_integration.py`)

├── app_state.py             # Centralized state (NEW)
├── settings_db.py           # SQLite CRUD (NEW)

## 🧪 Tests

**New Tests:** 4 passing unit tests
- `tests/test_settings_db.py` - SQLite CRUD operations
- `tests/test_app_state.py` - State mutation and defaults

**Existing Tests:** All existing tests still pass (detect_windows, cleaning, cleanerml_loader)

## 🎯 What's Working

### Easy Mode ✅
- Progress bar with 3 steps
- Browser grid (placeholder data)
- Option cards (placeholder)
- Navigation (Back/Next/Finish)
- Responsive scrolling

### Advanced Mode ✅
- Sidebar with browser list
- Search box (UI only)
- **Scan button** (✅ WIRED - calls real detection)
- Main panel with header
- Quick presets (UI only)
- Option cards (placeholder)
- Action buttons (UI only)

### Settings Dialog ✅
- General tab (mode, theme, autoscan)
- Debug tab (toggle, log level)
- Advanced tab (CleanerML path)
- Save/Cancel/Reset buttons
- All settings persist to SQLite

### Debug Panel ✅
- Variables tab with refresh
- Console tab with live logs
- Toggleable from settings
- Properly wired to loguru

## 🔄 What's Not Wired (By Design - Placeholder UIs)

### Easy Mode
- ❌ Step 0: Shows sample browsers (not live scan results)
- ❌ Step 1: Static option cards (not real CleanerML)
- ❌ Step 2: Placeholder preview text
- ❌ "Finish & Clean" doesn't execute

### Advanced Mode
- ❌ Quick Presets don't filter
- ❌ Option cards are static (not loaded from CleanerML)
- ❌ Checkboxes don't track state
- ❌ "Preview All" and "Clean Selected" don't execute

**Note:** The spec intentionally left these as placeholders. The integration helpers exist in `gui_integration.py` (run_scan, load_cleaner_options, preview_selected_options, execute_clean) - they just need to be wired to the UI elements.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Fixed Issues
1. ✅ `border_color="transparent"` error → Changed to proper colors
2. ✅ Legacy GUI appearing on startup → Added explicit `return` after mainloop
3. ✅ Scan button not working → Wired to `run_scan()` with live browser list updates
4. ✅ Console widget destroyed on mode switch → Protected against destroyed widget errors
5. ✅ Ugly Windows 95 colors → Modernized with vibrant palette
6. ✅ Non-responsive Easy Mode → Added scrollable areas and proper grid expansion
